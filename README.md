# RSSIIndoorLocation

This repository is dedicated to test a dataset of RSSI Indoor Location Algorithm, currently using Trilateration and KNN.

## Installation

To install this project start downloading the git repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/alefelipeoliveira/RSSIIndoorLocation.git
```

## Requirements

Libraries ```matplotib```, ```streamlit```, ```pandas```, ```copy``` and ```statistics``` are necessary.
```
$ pip install matplotlib streamlit pandas copy statistics
```
## Run

Streamlit creates a frontend environment to run different algorithms in the datasets, after installed strealit library, is possible to run the application in the local file, with the command
```
$ streamlit run .\main.py
```
